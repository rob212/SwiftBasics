# Swift Playground Basics

This playground is documenting me refreshing my Swift programming.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Variables and Constants:** Learn how to declare and use variables
* **Data Types:** Explore different data types such as integers, floats, booleans, strings, and arrays.
* **Operators:** Understand how to use operators for arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations.
* **Control Flow:** Learn about control flow statements like `if-else`, `switch`, and loops (`for`, `while`).
* **Functions:** Define and call functions to encapsulate reusable blocks of code.
